        <p>HTML is the foundational language for creating web pages. It structures content using elements enclosed in tags, which are typically written using angle brackets (< >), like headings (h1), paragraphs (p), and links (a). These elements define how information is displayed on a webpage. Are you really reading this. HTML also handles images, forms, and multimedia integration. Essentially, it's the blueprint that provides the framework for a website's layout and content.
